# FSM_API (Unity Integration)

**Seamlessly integrate the blazing-fast, software-agnostic Finite State Machine system into your Unity projects.**

> Designed for flexibility. Built for robustness. Ready for anything.


---

## 🔍 Overview

**FSM_API** is a modular, runtime-safe, and fully event-aware Finite State Machine (FSM) system designed to plug directly into **any C# application**—from enterprise software to games, simulations, robotics, or reactive systems.

- ✅ **Thread-safe operations** (main thread only, deferred mutation handling)
- 🧠 **Decoupled state logic from data**
- 🏗️ **Define once, instantiate many**
- 🛠️ **Error-tolerant FSM lifecycle management**
- 🧪 **Dynamic update ticking with frame/process throttling**

**No Unity dependency. No frameworks required. No boilerplate setup.**

## 💡 Why FSM_API?

Typical FSM systems are tightly coupled to their target environment or force you into rigid coding patterns. FSM_API flips the paradigm:

## 🚀 Quickstart (Non-Unity Example)

Define a simple context:

```csharp
public class LightSwitch : IStateContext
{
    public bool IsOn = false;
    public bool IsValid => true;
    public string Name { get; set; } = "KitchenLight";
}
 ````
Define and build your FSM:
```csharp
FSM_API.CreateProcessingGroup("MainLoop");

var fsm = FSM_API.CreateFiniteStateMachine("LightSwitchFSM", processRate: 1, processingGroup: "MainLoop")
    .State("Off")
        .OnEnter(ctx => { if (ctx is LightSwitch l) l.IsOn = false; })
        .TransitionIf("On", ctx => ctx is LightSwitch)
    .State("On")
        .OnEnter(ctx => { if (ctx is LightSwitch l) l.IsOn = true; })
        .TransitionIf("Off", ctx => ctx is LightSwitch l && !l.IsOn)
    .BuildDefinition();
 ````
Create an instance:
```csharp
var kitchenLight = new LightSwitch();
var handle = FSM_API.CreateInstance("LightSwitchFSM", kitchenLight, "MainLoop");
 ````
Tick the FSM from your main loop:
```csharp
FSM_API.Update("MainLoop");
 ````

| Capability                      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| :------------------------------ | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🔄 **Deterministic State Logic** | Effortlessly define **predictable state changes** based on **dynamic conditions** or **explicit triggers**, ensuring your application's behavior is consistent and, where applicable, **mathematically provable**. Ideal for complex workflows and reliable automation.                                                                                   |
| 🎭 **Context-Driven Behavior** | Your FSM logic directly operates on **any custom C# object (POCO)** that implements `IStateContext`. This enables **clean separation of concerns** (logic vs. data) and allows domain experts (e.g., BIM specifiers) to define behavior patterns that developers then implement.                                                                 |
| 🧪 **Flexible Update Control** | Choose how FSMs are processed: **event-driven**, **tick-based** (every N frames), or **manual**. This adaptability means it's perfect for **real-time systems, background processes, or even complex user interactions** within any application loop.                                                                                             |
| 🧯 **Robust Error Escalation** | Benefit from **per-instance and per-definition error tracking**, providing immediate insights to prevent runaway logic or invalid states **without crashing your application**. Critical for long-running services and mission-critical software.                                                                                              |
| 🔁 **Runtime Redefinition** | Adapt your application on the fly! FSM definitions can be **redefined while actively running**, enabling **dynamic updates, live patching, and extreme behavioral variation** without recompilation or downtime. Perfect for highly configurable systems.                                                                                      |
| 🎯 **Lightweight & Performant** | Engineered for **minimal memory allocations** and **optimized performance**, ensuring your FSMs are efficient even in demanding enterprise or simulation scenarios. No overhead, just pure C# power.                                                                                                                                        |
| 🌐 **Seamless Unity Integration** | Specifically designed for Unity developers, this layer offers **dedicated helper methods** and **clear examples** tailored for Unity's lifecycle, making FSM management a breeze within game development.                                                                                                                                |
| 🔬 **Core API Link** | This Unity integration is **built on the robust [FSM_API Core Library](https://github.com/TrentBest/FSM_API)**. The core provides a solid, **platform-agnostic foundation** ideal for any C# environment where state management is critical.                                                                                               |
| ✅ **Easy to Unit Test** | The inherent **decoupling of FSM logic from context data** ensures your state machines are **highly testable in isolation**, leading to more robust and reliable code with simplified unit testing.                                                                                                                                        |
| 💯 **Mathematically Provable** | With clearly defined states and transitions, the FSM architecture lends itself to **formal verification and rigorous analysis**, providing a strong foundation for high-assurance systems where correctness is paramount.                                                                                                                       |
| 🤝 **Collaborative Design** | FSMs provide a **visual and structured way to define complex behaviors**, fostering better communication between developers, designers, and domain experts, and enabling less code-savvy individuals to contribute to core logic definitions.                                                                                              |
