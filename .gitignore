# =========================
# üì¶ Unity Package Manager (UPM)
# =========================
# Ignore local PackageCache, as Unity regenerates it
/Packages/PackageCache/
# Optionally, if you only manage packages via manifest.json, ignore the actual packages folder itself.
# /Packages/*
# Except the manifest files you want to track
# !/Packages/manifest.json
# !/Packages/packages-lock.json

# =========================
# üí° IDE & Project Files
# =========================
# Visual Studio & Rider temporary/user files
.vs/
*.suo
*.user
*.userosf
*.userprefs

# JetBrains Rider
.idea/

# Automatically generated C# project files (common practice to ignore to avoid conflicts)
*.csproj
!Assembly-CSharp.csproj
!Assembly-CSharp-Editor.csproj
*.unityproj

# Solution file (generally recommended to track for team cohesion)
# If you decide to track it, uncomment the line below.
# !*.sln
# If you prefer to ignore it (and let Unity regenerate it for each user), keep it commented or remove the !

# =========================
# üé® Asset Specific Ignored Files
# =========================
# By default Unity supports Blender asset imports, *.blend1 blender files do not need to be committed to version control.
*.blend1
*.blend1.meta

# =========================
# üóëÔ∏è Other Temporary Files
# =========================
# OSX
.DS_Store

# Temporary files
*.tmp
*.bak

# Crashlytics/Unity Crash Reporter
crash.dmp

# Hidden Unity files (less common but good for completeness)
.fuse_hidden*
.svn

# Uncomment this line if you wish to ignore the asset store tools plugin
# /[Aa]ssets/AssetStoreTools*

# Ignore any .meta files for ignored files
# This line should ideally be at the end, but specific ignore rules can override it.
# e.g., if you ignore /Assets/SomeFolder/, its meta will be ignored too.
# If you ignore *.unity (e.g., scene files), then *.unity.meta will also be ignored implicitly.
# This might be redundant if your specific file ignores also handle their meta.
# However, if you explicitly ignore certain non-Unity files, their .meta should also be ignored.
# *.meta
